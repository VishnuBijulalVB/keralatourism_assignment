        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
          Splendid, robust and replete with flavors, each of these dishes will certainly make you a fan of Kerala cuisine. Discover the smorgasbord of food varieties available in different parts of Kerala. One of the traditional Kerala dishes is vegetarian and is called the Kerala sadhya, which is an elaborate banquet prepared for festivals and ceremonies. A full-course sadhya, which consists of rice with about 20 different accompaniments and desserts, is the ceremonial meal of Kerala eaten usually on celebratory occasions including marriages, Onam and Vishu. It is served on a plantain leaf. Because of its rich trading heritage, over time various indigenous Kerala dishes have been blended with foreign dishes to adapt them to local tastes. Coconuts grow in abundance in Kerala, so grated coconut and coconut milk are commonly used for thickening and flavouring. Kerala's long coastline and numerous rivers have led to a strong fishing industry in the region, making seafood a common part of meals. Rice is grown in abundance along with tapioca. It is the main starch ingredient used in Kerala's food.

        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
          The festival season, the pride and joy of Kerala, is epitomised by the ferocious beats of the chenda (drums) emanating across the landscape. Elephants march across towns and the rivers surge with massive 100 feet long snake boats in a display that can only be experienced in an area renowned as God's Own Country. The entire State celebrates together as the land is covered in a plethora of lights and merriment. Our festivals celebrate the traditions passed down by our ancestors. Be it Onam, Eid or Christmas, all of Kerala rejoices with one spirit to bring the entire coastal State to life. From seeing mystical figures come to life during Theyyam performances to strolling across various churches and mosques where the lights and displays are at their best during perunnals and memorials, every nook and cranny of our State has something to offer to each traveller. Onam is the State festival which is celebrated by every household across the land. According to mythology, Mahabali was an Asura (demon) king who brought about peace and prosperity in the land. He makes his yearly rounds to check on his loyal subjects during the harvest festival of Onam. Malayalis invite him into their houses with aplomb to celebrate his homecoming and show him that the prosperity and contentment of his reign continues even to this day. Onasadya or vegetarian feasts with up to 60 separate dishes that are served are a highlight of this festival.

        <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
          Indigenous to the Western Ghat’s Shola forests, Neelakurinji or Kurinji (scientific name: Strobilanthes kunthianus) is a plant that belongs to the ‘Acanthaceae’ and genus ‘Strobilanthes’. This plant is rare, and usually grows at an elevation of 1,300-2,400m. Being favourable, the Nilgiri Range in Munnar serves as the blooming found of this rare species. Neelakurinji is a species that synchronises its flowering period, but within a period of twelve years. They grow all at once; though blooming might vary with a few days, they mostly grow at the same time profusely. Life span for the species also follows synchronisation; with slight variations. Thus, when the Neelakurinji blossom occurs, they creates a phantasm of encrusting the entire area, which looks no less than magical!
